## Build tools & versions used
XCode Version 15.2 (15C500b)

## Steps to run the app
Download the repository and run the Lightning Study.xcodeproj on Xcode.

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
The project was designed to be structured in UIKit and an MVVM-C architecture using OOP to carry out contracts between screens, facilitating testing.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
It was designed to facilitate testing and code reading for future maintenance or addition of new features

## How long did you spend on this project?
I spent one day, something about 5 or 6 hours.

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
Maybe a more pleasant interface, with a better experience, like adding pagination to the TableView to avoid consuming too much data.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
Without a doubt the interface and the lack of coverage for possible errors when consuming the API. Currently the project only covers a generic error.

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
The project was built with some custom components developed by me to facilitate the creation and implementation of screens in everyday life. These components also bring a simpler and more beautiful construction that closely resembles the way interfaces are built using SwiftUI.
